This Repo is specifically because I had issues setting up the website through Git Hub on my original repo.
The other initiative tracker website shows all of the changes made throughout my code over the 2 weeks I worked on this project.

This website was made for my and others' use in tracking initiatives for D&D and other similar-style Tabletop RPG games.
My goal was to make a fully functioning website with all of the features needed for easy tracking and setting up of initiatives.
