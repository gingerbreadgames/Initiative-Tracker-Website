This Repo is specifically because I had issues setting up the website through github on my original repo.
The other initiative tracker website shows all of the changes made throughout my code over the 2 weeks I worked on this project.

This website wsa made for my and others use on tracking initiative for D&D and other similar style Table Top RPG games.
My goal was to make a fully functioning website with all of the features need for easy tracking and setting up of initiative.
